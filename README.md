# copliot-demo-simple-webpage

I want to demonstrate how to use copilot to create a simple static webpage which should be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Steps

1. Creating the copilot-instructions.md file
2. Get Feedback "What would a Senior Developer have for question when reading this discerption of a software project?"
3. Adapt some of this to the copilot-instructions.md file
4. Github Copilot Edits Prompt: "Create all the files for a simple, non-functional prototype to demonstrate the structure of the project, remembering that this should be hosted on github pages."
5. Follow up prompt: "How to setup Github Pages?" and dollow the instructions
6. Follow up prompt: "Set Default values in view; Implement everthing, like storage, default values, api call, playpack and download of the response mp3 file"
