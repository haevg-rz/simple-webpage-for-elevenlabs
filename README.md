# copliot-demo-simple-webpage

I want to demonstrate how to use copilot to create a simple static webpage which should be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Steps

1. Creating the copilot-instructions.md file
2. Get Feedback "What would a Senior Developer have for question when reading this discerption of a software project?"
3. Adapt some of this to the copilot-instructions.md file
